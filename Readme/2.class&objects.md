# Class & Objects

`src/L2_Peps.java`

- If you have public class in your file, the name of the file must match with the name of the public class
- Public class of your source file must have the main method
- Class name starts with an Upper case letter - is convention not a rule

### Constructors
A constructor in Java is a special method that:
- Constructor name must match the class name exactly
- Should not have any return type (not even void)
- Is used to create objects (`new Person(...)`)
- Can be overloaded 
  - can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists, but must same name as class
- Syntax to create an object (i.e. new instance of a class)
    ```ignorelang
    <ClassType> objectName = new <ClassName>
    ```
