# Java Queue Interface - Complete Study Notes

## 1. Overview

The Queue interface is a fundamental part of Java's Collections Framework, extending the Collection interface. 
It follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) ruleâ€”the first element added to the queue is the first to be removed.

### Key Characteristics:
- **FIFO Ordering**: Elements are processed in the order they were inserted
- **No Random Access**: Unlike List, elements cannot be accessed directly by index
- **Allows Duplicates**: Can contain duplicate elements
- **Dynamic Size**: Automatically resizes based on the number of elements
- **Use generics** to ensure type safety

## Queue Hierarchy

    A[Collection Interface] --> B[Queue Interface]
    B --> C[LinkedListQueue]
    B --> D[PriorityQueue]
    B --> E[ArrayDeque]
```

## Core Queue Operations

### Terminology:
- **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the queue (rear/tail)
- **Dequeue**: Removing an element from the queue (front/head)
- **Head/Peek**: The first element in the queue (next to be removed)
- **Tail/Rear**: The last element in the queue (most recently added)

### Queue Operation Flow:

    C --> D[HEAD/FRONT]
    D --> E[Elements Exit]
```

## Queue Method Categories

The Queue interface provides two forms of methods for insertion, removal, and inspection operations:

| Operation   | Exception Method | Safe Method | Behavior on Empty Queue          |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Insert**  | `add(e)`         | `offer(e)`  | Throws exception vs Returns null |
| **Remove**  | `remove()`       | `poll()`    | Throws exception vs Returns null |
| **Examine** | `element()`      | `peek()`    | Returns null vs Returns false    |

### Method Differences:
- The `remove()` and `poll()` methods differ only in their behavior when the queue is empty: the `remove()` method throws an exception, while the `poll()` method returns `null`
- The `element()` and `peek()` methods return, but do not remove, the head of the queue

## Implementation Approaches

### LinkedList Queue Implementation (FIFO Order)

LinkedList Queue implements the Queue interface, providing first in, first out (FIFO) queue operations. This maintains insertion order.

### PriorityQueue Implementation (Natural Ordering)

The PriorityQueue class is a priority queue based on the heap data structure. This queue orders elements according to the order specified. PriorityQueue does not care about FIFO / LIFO. it handles priority.

### LinkedListQueue vs PriorityQueue Characteristics

| Aspect          | LinkedListQueue        | PriorityQueue             |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Ordering**    | FIFO (insertion order) | Natural ordering (sorted) |
| **Performance** | O(1) add/remove        | O(log n) add/remove       |
| **Use Case**    | Basic unbounded queue  | Priority-based processing |
| **Memory**      | More memory overhead   | Compact heap structure    |

## Real-World Applications

- **Task Scheduling**: Using PriorityQueue for priority-based task execution
- **Breadth-First Search**: Using LinkedList queue for BFS traversal
- **Print Queue**: Managing print jobs in FIFO order
- **Buffer Management**: Handling streaming data with bounded queues
